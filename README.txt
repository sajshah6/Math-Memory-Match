I created an educational math game hoping to help young children with arithmetic. My game randomly generates 18 unique math expressions with each one on its own respective card. The user is then prompted to flip over two cards at a time hoping to match equivalent expressions. If the cards contain equivalent math expressions, then the cards will disappear; otherwise, they will remain on the board. The user is also encouraged to make all the cards disappear as quickly as possible in hopes of beating their previous time.
