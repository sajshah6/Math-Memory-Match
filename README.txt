Match Memory Match

Description: I created an educational math game hoping to help young children with arithmetic. My game randomly generates 18 unique math expressions with each one on its own respective card. The user is prompted to match equivalent expressions to make the cards disappear. The user is also encouraged to make all the cards disappear as quickly as possible in hopes of beating their previous time.
